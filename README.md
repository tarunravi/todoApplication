#Todo Application for Bits Of Good Developer Application
Hi! I'm Tarun Ravikumar. I only knew of this club and application process yesterday, so I didn't have much time to implement everything. Regardless I built out the MVP! I hope you enjoy it!!!

#How it works
The front end is in React. I know to code in Flask for the backend, but this task doesn't require it. You can add the title, tags, and date. Then you can remove each of the to-do tasks. 

All the parts are broken into components, this makes it easier to break up a project into smaller parts. Each part can then be worked on by a different person. 


#Features Missing
Because I only had limited time to build it, I couldn't build everything. Given more time, I could easily fully finish it. I would like to have added more CSS styling. I'd also like a mobile view, but again this is just more CSS. This isn't hard, but it takes a while (because CSS is a pain!). I also wanted to add an option to remove specific tags. The logic behind this feature would be very similar to the logic behind removing specific tasks. Again this is an easy thing to do, I just didn't have time. Lastly, the option to sort was missing on my MVP. Again this isn't the hardest thing to do, I would just have to sort the task list by date. 

I tried to do all the hard parts first to show my proficiency in react and webdevelopment. 

#Closing
I really hope I get the developer position, this is my first GT club and I'm extremely passionate about it. I really love coding and this club seems perfect!
